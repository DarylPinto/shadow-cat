## Why

[Nvidia Shadowplay](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/) is an awesome way to capture gaming highlights, and I've used it countless times. However, the first thing you want to do after you save a highlight is show it to your friends or post it online, right? Well it can be *pretty darn annoying* to have to open up a video editor, crop and trim the video, render it and then go online to upload it.

Now you don't have to! Open your video in Shadow Cat, and you'll have a link to share in no time.
